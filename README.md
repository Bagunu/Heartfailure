# Heart Disease UCI-Diagnosis & Prediction <br>
## Data-set description<br>
Context
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date.<br>
Dataset columns:<br>
age: The person’s age in years<br>
sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)<br>
cp: chest pain type<br>
— Value 0: asymptomatic<br>
— Value 1: atypical angina<br>
— Value 2: non-anginal pain<br>
— Value 3: typical angina<br>
trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)<br>
chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl<br>
fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)<br>
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results<br>
— Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria<br>
— Value 1: normal<br>
— Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)<br>
thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved<br>
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)<br>
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)<br>
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment — 0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping<br>
ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)<br>
thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously<br>
Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)<br>
Value 2: normal blood flow<br>
Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)<br>
target: Heart disease (1 = no, 0= yes)<br>
